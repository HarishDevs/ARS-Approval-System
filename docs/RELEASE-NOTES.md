# Release notes

## v1.6.1 (10 Oct 2026): files in forms, and collaborators
**For IT**
- **Attachments as a form field:** in the workflow builder, add a field of type **Attachments (files)**. Make it required (at least one file) and choose up to 1–5 files. Requesters attach files right there, and the files show under that field on the request.

**For everyone**
- **Collaborators:** when you raise a request (standard or custom), add anyone in the organisation to follow it, as many as 20 people. They can see it, comment and add files, and they're told how it goes. They don't approve. Add or remove people later on the request page; a collaborator can stop following.
- **My requests → Shared with me** lists the requests people added you to.

## v1.6.0 (10 Oct 2026): clearer, safer, measurable
**For everyone**
- **A refreshed look:** dark mode, a command palette (Ctrl K), keyboard shortcuts in Waiting for me, clearer errors with a summary at the top, toasts with Undo, and a phone navigation bar.
- **Check before submitting:** see missing fields, missing files, possible duplicates and the budget position before you submit. Possible duplicates need a short reason.
- **Smarter forms:** fields that appear only when needed, worked-out amounts, and line items with GST.
- **Templates and "raise again":** save a request as a template, or start a new one from an earlier request. Your department fills in from your profile.
- **Amend an approved request** (where IT allows it): change the allowed fields with a reason. The approval steps run again; the original approval stays on record.
- **Recall** a request before anyone decides; **answer questions** from approvers; see **links and follow-ups**.
- **Analytics:** your requests, your approvals, your team or department; KPI cards compared with the previous period; charts with table views; aging and response-time status.
- **Reports:** ready-made reports in Excel, CSV or PDF; save filters; have a report emailed to you on a schedule; set alerts when a number crosses your line.

**For approvers**
- **Ask for information**, **ask a colleague for advice**, or **pass one approval** to an eligible colleague.

**For IT**
- **Needs attention:** blocked steps, inactive approvers, requests with no activity, unsent messages and workflow states that don't add up, each with what to do.
- **Submission checks per type:** duplicate fields, minimum files, budget check, amendable fields.
- **Budgets** per department and financial year.
- **Versions:** compare any two, restore an old one as a draft, and **move open requests** to the live version safely.
- **Import and export** approval types between the test and live sites (always as a draft).

**For the Super Admin**
- **Automation:** every background job, its health and history; run now; resend messages that weren't sent.
- **Retention & legal holds:** holds stop records being deleted; the retention dry run shows what a policy would affect (nothing is deleted).
- **Feature switches:** turn new features on, off, or on for the IT team only.

## v1.5.0 (9 Oct 2026): easier every day
**For everyone**
- **My work** (the first page) shows what needs you first: due soon and overdue, waiting for you, returned for changes, your drafts, your recent requests and what finished lately. New people see a short "five things to know" list until they hide it.
- **Drafts:** what you type in a new request or custom approval is saved as you go. Come back to it from My work, or discard it. Submitting removes the draft; drafts go after 30 days.
- **Where is it now?** A line above the level map says who it's waiting for, since when, what comes next, and how many steps are done.
- **Search** finds any request you're allowed to see, with filters; save a search as a view.
- **Phones:** lists become cards, and buttons are easier to tap.
- **Notification settings** (Profile → Notifications → Settings): switch off email or WhatsApp for updates, reminders, comments and FYIs. Approvals waiting for you and security messages always come.
- **@mentions:** type `@` and a User ID in a comment to tell someone who can already see the request.
- **Download PDF** on a request: details, levels, decisions and history in one file.
- **Out of office** explains what your delegate will see, and lists what is waiting for you now.
- **Help** (sidebar): how-tos, what each status means, and **Copy details for IT**.

**For approvers**
- **Approve several at once** on Waiting for me: tick, review the list, approve. Work tasks and requests on hold are done one by one.
- A **due soon** heads-up comes before the response time runs out.

**For IT**
- **Workload** (Admin): who has how much waiting, how old it is, what is overdue.
- **Hand over** suggests the people with the fewest approvals waiting.
- **Test mode** shows which way each choice went, why steps were skipped, and how the route differs from the live version; it also says which requests a publish would affect.

**For the Super Admin**
- An alert (once a day) if the scheduled jobs or the daily backup fail.
- Every page and error has a **reference** that matches the server log.

## v1.4.0 (9 Oct 2026): everything pending
**For everyone**
- **Work tasks:** after approval, a step can hand work to someone, often the requester (e.g. raise the PO). It shows as **To do**, and they press **Mark as done**.
- **FYI steps** tell people (e.g. Finance) that a request reached a point; nothing to do.
- **Waiting for me** and **Notifications** have pages; custom approvals take attachments.
- New messages: task for you, FYI, request resumed, changes made, request removed, request moving again.
- The app can be installed on a phone ("Add to Home screen").

**For IT**
- **Builder:**
  - step kinds (approval, work, FYI);
  - approvers by **designation** (optionally the requester's department);
  - rules with several conditions (**all** or **any**);
  - choices inside choices;
  - a warning before leaving with unsaved changes.
- **Stuck requests** show **Stuck: needs IT** on the request page: give the step to people, skip it, try again, or pick a path.
- **Approval types:** remove one that was never used, or archive it; choose where a resubmitted request restarts; make a good custom approval into an approval type.
- **Escalation** goes up the management chain (up to 3 levels).
- Dashboards count approvals only (not work tasks).

**For the Super Admin**
- **Backups:** daily, plus **Back up now**, with a tested restore (deployment guide Part P).
- **Audit log CSV download**, and **Sign-in history**.
- **WhatsApp delivery receipts** (with the webhook), and a **health check** for an uptime monitor.
- Optional **origin lock** to Cloudflare, and optional **Power BI views**.

**Fixes and hardening**
- **Deleting a request:**
  - closes it properly;
  - tells the people waiting.
- **Publishing:** two people publishing at once can't clash.
- **Handover:** the new approver gets the full response time.
- **Hold:** time on hold doesn't count against the response time.
- **Request numbers:** the year follows India time.
- **Updates:** a failed update can carry on where it stopped.
- **Sign-in:**
  - a locked account isn't revealed to guessers;
  - "This wasn't me" links work once.
- **Google sign-in** accepts Google identities only.
- **IT Admin accounts:** one IT Admin can't change another's contact details.
- **Settings and logs:** safer provider settings and log masking.

## v1.3.6 (9 Oct 2026): fixes from the application audit
- **Fixed:** on an admin's user page, **Deactivate user** and **Sign out everywhere** now ask for confirmation and then work. Before, they did nothing.
- **Idle sign-out:** you're signed out after **2 hours without activity** (Super Admin can set 15–720 minutes under Sign-in security). Sessions still end 12 hours after sign-in.
- **Safer sign-in links:** after signing in, the app only returns you to a page inside this site.
- **One-time codes:** the limit of wrong tries per code now holds even for simultaneous guesses.
- **Messages waiting for a retry** (which can contain set-password links) are stored encrypted and deleted once sent, or after 7 days.
- **Email sending** gives up after 15 seconds instead of waiting indefinitely, and is retried by the job runner.

## v1.3.5 (9 Oct 2026)
- **Profile page:** in My approvals, the sidebar now has one **Profile** entry. It shows your details (department, designation, reporting manager and more), with tabs for **Notifications**, **Out of office** and **Sign-in & devices**. Old links still work.
- The account menu (top right) has a Profile link.
- New: `docs/APPLICATION_CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT.md`, a full audit of what is built, verified, missing and at risk.

## v1.3.4 (9 Oct 2026)
- **Security updates:** Next.js 15.5.27 and firebase-admin 14.5.0. The production dependency audit is now clean (0 known vulnerabilities).
- **Sign-in protection:** the per-address sign-in limit now uses the visitor's real address from Cloudflare, so it can't be dodged by faking a header.
- **Email** is sent from `no_reply@approval.arssteels.net` by default (replies still go to IT).
- **Super Admin → Message deliveries** shows when the job runner last ran, and warns if the cron job isn't running.
- The deployment guide has a step-by-step cron job setup (Part I).

## v1.3.3 (9 Oct 2026)
- The "People" picker (custom approvals and workflow steps) now has an accessible name for screen readers.
- Live notification test: WhatsApp works for request events. Email is blocked by Resend (HTTP 403) until the sending domain is verified in the Resend account that owns the API key (see DEPLOYMENT.md G2).

## v1.3.2 (9 Oct 2026): fix from the live test
- **Live fix:** the Import data page and the Audit log raised a page error (React #418) on the live site. Cloudflare rewrote the email addresses they showed. Addresses are now shown so Cloudflare leaves them alone, here and in everything people type (request titles, comments, field values, timeline, notifications, out-of-office reasons).
- A new automated check fails the build if any page shows an address in a form Cloudflare would rewrite.

## v1.3.1 (9 Oct 2026): reliability fixes from the QA audits
- **Forms no longer crash the page.** When the server errors, the connection drops, an upload is cut off, or the session has ended, the form now says so ("You're offline…", "Couldn't reach the server…", "Your session has ended…") and keeps what you typed. Before, the page went blank with "Application error".
- **No endless spinners:** after 30 seconds a form stops waiting and says the action may still have gone through.
- **Loading feedback:** a spinner on the menu link you clicked, and on dashboard period and page links. Quick period changes now always show the period you clicked last.
- **Readable busy buttons** (contrast 4.72:1, was 1.42:1); buttons keep their size while busy; screen readers hear "Working…".
- A friendly error page instead of a blank one, if anything else goes wrong.
- Workflow builder: every field has an accessible name.
- Audits: `docs/qa/LOADER-QA-REPORT.md` (retest: 70/70 executed pass) and `docs/qa/E2E-QA-REPORT.md`.

## v1.3.0 (8 Oct 2026): the form field creator
- **Fixed after testing key by key:**
  - **Dropdowns:** options are now a list. Type one and press Enter or **Add option**, or paste several at once. Duplicates are refused. Before, the box dropped every comma, so only one option could be made.
  - **Field keys** follow the whole label (before, "Delivery Date" became `d`). Saved keys are locked.
  - **Number boxes** keep a decimal point or a minus sign while you type.
  - **Dates in conditions:** "skip when *Needed by* is before / after …" uses a date picker and now works. Every condition's value box matches its field: a dropdown for options and lists, people for a person, numbers for amounts.
- **New: Department and Designation fields from the database.** The requester picks from the live list of active departments or designations; conditions can use them, e.g. skip a level for one department.
- **Help text** under any field.
- **Test mode** keeps the valid sample values even when one is wrong.
- **The request page** shows a level as "Skipped: <reason>" as soon as its condition applies, not only when it is reached.
- Dates show as 01 Dec 2026.

## v1.2.0 (8 Oct 2026): approver designations, request deletion, dashboards
- **Approver designations:** Admin → Departments → Designations has an **Approver** tick. Tick Manager and above.
  - Only people whose designation is ticked can be chosen as approvers: named workflow and custom approval steps, approver group members, department HOD, reporting manager, out-of-office delegate, handover, and person fields that pick an approver.
  - Choices already saved stay valid until changed.
  - Every existing designation starts ticked; untick the junior ones. New designations start unticked.
  - Import has a new `approver` column for designations.
- **Super Admin → Requests:** every request, searchable, with **Delete** (a reason is required). Also on the request page.
  - A deleted request leaves every screen, queue, reminder and report, and its pending approvals are cancelled.
  - The **Deleted** tab and the audit log keep who, when and why. There is no undo.
- **Admin → Dashboards**, four pages, each with a date, type and department filter and a CSV download:
  - **Utilisation**: every approval type, used or not;
  - **Department-wise raised**;
  - **Approver-wise**: given, decided, waiting, overdue, average time, on-time %;
  - **Raiser-wise by department**: with department subtotals.
  - The default period is the financial year to date.

## v1.1.0 (8 Oct 2026): bulk import
- **Import data** in the Admin and Super Admin spaces, for **Users, Departments, Designations, Approver groups and Holidays**:
  - **Download template** (CSV with the header row) or **Download current data** (the same columns, filled in, to edit and re-upload);
  - **Upload → Check file**: a dry run that shows new, changed, unchanged and problem rows, every problem by row and column, and a downloadable problem list;
  - **Import**: all rows in one go, or none.
  - The same rules as the forms: only the Super Admin grants Super Admin; password sign-in needs WhatsApp; no reporting loops; emails and numbers stay unique.
  - Each change and each import is in the audit log, and people whose WhatsApp number or sign-in method changed get the usual alert.
- **Loaders:** spinners on Download, Check and Import; a "Checking… / Importing… please keep this page open" bar; the controls are locked while working; a skeleton while the page loads.
- An **Import** button on the Users, Departments, Approver groups and Working calendar pages.

## v1.0.6 (8 Oct 2026): UI polish
- **Spaces:** My approvals, Admin and Super Admin are now called *spaces*. Your name at the top right opens one menu with your space, **Switch space**, Notifications, Sign-in & devices and **Sign out**.
- **Phones:** a menu button opens the page list as a drawer. Before this there was no menu below tablet width.
- **My approvals:** "Welcome back", compact counters that open the matching list, the top 5 items waiting and recent; My requests has one bar for search, filter and New request.
- **Admin:** the overview shows every module as a live card with counts (no more "Being built").
- **Super Admin → WhatsApp templates:** a status panel (how many are live, last sync, Sync button), short message names with the description behind "?", and tidy Open/Create buttons.
- Clearer active menu item, hover on cards and rows, softer cards, and content centred on wide screens.

## v1.0.5 (8 Oct 2026)
- **The Super Admin signs in with Google as `itsupport@arsenergy.co.in`** (D-082). `itadmin@arssteels.co.in` is an alias of another mailbox, and Google always reports the primary address, so it never matched (`UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT`).
- A one-time migration moves the bootstrap account (User ID `itadmin`, all its roles) to the new email.
- The bootstrap seed no longer overwrites the account on every start, so later edits in Admin → Users stay.

## v1.0.4 (8 Oct 2026): first live fixes
- **Email addresses on pages no longer break the page.** GoDaddy's Cloudflare layer rewrote any address in the HTML (email obfuscation) and injected a script the CSP blocks, which caused React error #418. Addresses are now rendered so Cloudflare leaves them alone; they look the same.
- **Google sign-in:**
  - the Firebase private key is accepted with or without surrounding quotes, as literal `
`, real line breaks or CRLF;
  - when a Google token can't be verified, the reason is written to the runtime log (never the token).

## v1.0.3 (8 Oct 2026)
- **Build fix:** `npm run build` removes the old `.next` folder first. GoDaddy reuses the app folder between builds, which broke Next.js with `ENOENT rename …/export/500.html`.
- **Email sender** is now `approvals@arssteels.net`, the domain verified in Resend. A new **Reply-to** setting defaults to `itadmin@arssteels.co.in`, so replies reach IT. Both can be changed in Super Admin → Providers & security → Email.

## v1.0.2 (8 Oct 2026)
- `npm start` now applies the database migrations and seeds before starting, so the default start command on GoDaddy creates and updates the database by itself. GoDaddy's "Import SQL" answered "Unauthorized", and the importer drops existing tables. `npm run start:app` starts without migrating.
- Deployment guide Part B updated: automatic setup first; the SQL import only as an option, with its warnings.

## v1.0.1 (deployment helpers, 8 Oct 2026)
- `npm run start:production` applies the database migrations and seeds, then starts the app. GoDaddy's Node.js hosting may have no terminal, so the first start sets up the database by itself, and later releases migrate themselves. Both scripts skip what's already done.
- `npm run db:check` runs the MySQL privilege check (triggers).
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` is rewritten as a complete step-by-step guide (Parts A–O) for the "Deploy your Node.js app" wizard, including Resend domain verification, a new CEOITBox key, the secrets-file import, cron and troubleshooting.
- No change to app behaviour.

## v1.0.0 — first production release (8 Oct 2026)
The ARS Approval Platform: **multi-level approvals in any custom manner**. It replaces the 104 Asana approval projects.
Deploy with `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

### What's in it
- **Sign-in and security:**
  - Google sign-in;
  - User ID + password with a WhatsApp code;
  - new-device alerts and "This wasn't me";
  - lockout and rate limits;
  - 12-hour server-side sessions;
  - strict security headers and CSP;
  - append-only audit log;
  - break-glass account.
- **Role areas:** `/users` (everyone), `/admin` (IT team), `/superadmin` (itadmin@ only). Everyone else gets a plain 404.
- **Approval engine:**
  - any number of levels;
  - sequential or parallel steps, with all / any-one / any-N approvers;
  - choices (if / otherwise) and skip rules;
  - approvers from people, groups, roles, the requester's manager or HOD, a named department's HOD, or a person picked on the form;
  - the requester never approves their own request;
  - a level with nobody to approve is blocked and IT is told, never silently passed.
- **DoA per approval type:** a matrix of amount limits × levels, set when the approval type is created. The DoA view shows every type's bands.
- **Requests:**
  - raise, approve, reject (reason required), ask for changes, then resubmit on the same number;
  - hold and resume;
  - withdraw by the requester; reopen by the Super Admin;
  - comments and attachments (PDF, images, Office, CSV, text; checked and never deleted);
  - custom approvals, where anyone routes to anyone;
  - My requests with search, a status filter and paging.
- **Out-of-office delegation; handover** of a leaver's approvals.
- **Response times on a working calendar** (working days and holidays), with reminders and escalation.
- **Notifications:**
  - in-app, email (Resend) and WhatsApp (CEOITBox);
  - an outbox, so nothing is lost on a crash;
  - automatic retries and a delivery log.
- **WhatsApp template creator:** write, submit to Meta, sync the status (approved goes live by itself), and test-send, through the CEOITBox API. Synced daily.
- **Insights** for IT: what's waiting where, how long each level takes, what's overdue.
- **Demo data** for trying the system before the real staff list, with **Try as**.

### Quality
- **Automated checks:** 213 unit tests, 53 MySQL integration tests and 15 browser end-to-end tests; lint, typecheck and a production build in CI on Node 22.
- **QA suite:** `docs/qa/QA-TEST-SUITE.md`, 600 test cases with smoke, sanity, regression and critical suites.
- **Defects fixed before release (S8-06):**
  - a negative amount skipped DoA levels;
  - a retried submit made a duplicate request;
  - a request raised twice from two tabs;
  - notifications lost on a crash;
  - an attachment limit race and duplicate uploads;
  - long comments cut without warning;
  - a WhatsApp template deleted at CEOITBox stayed live;
  - no search in My requests;
  - line breaks in email subjects.
- **Fixed during release preparation:** on Node 22 (GoDaddy) an empty file box made every plain submit fail. CI caught it; now fixed.

### Decisions kept as they are (owner, 8 Oct 2026)
- One person may approve more than one level of a request, directly or as a delegate.
- Requests don't expire.
- Rejection is final; "ask for changes" is the route back.

### Needs the owner after deploy
- Firebase Admin values.
- A Resend key.
- A **new** CEOITBox key for this app.
- The cron job.
- The `UPLOAD_DIR` folder.
- Submitting the 19 remaining WhatsApp templates.
- The real staff list, or the demo data in the meantime.
- Q-015: break-glass sign-in without WhatsApp.
